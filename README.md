# MastermindGameJava

This is a mastermind game which allows users to play as both the guesser and the mastermind.

The goal of the game is for the guesser to correctly identify the color and position of pegs that the mastermind chooses before the guesser runs out of guesses.
The guesser will receive a hint from the mastermind after every guess in the form of white and black pegs.
White pegs indicate a correct color in wrong slot.
Black pegs indicate a correct color in correct slot.
